  ## Description 
  Allows users to sort through many shows on multiple streaming services, archive their favorites, and see other users ratings.

   As an avid consumer of movie and TV streaming services, you want a way to easily find your favorite movies or TV series. Maybe your Bucket list is to watch every Avengers movie or all the Hobbit movies.  How do you find what streaming services are showing them?  The Bucket Team's Bucket List application solves that problem.  Using the Bucket List application, a user can enter a movie title or keyword into the search bar, then click on individual services and be presented a link of streaming services.  If you don't know what streaming service your program is showing, the user can simply click on the 'World' search button and search the top 9 streaming services in the US.
